# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving inter-claude-channels.

## Development

```bash
bun install        # install deps
bun test           # run the integration tests
bun x tsc --noEmit # typecheck
bun server.ts      # run the channel standalone (reads INTER_CLAUDE_NAME)
```

CI runs typecheck + tests on every push and PR; keep both green.

## Layout

- `server.ts` — the whole channel: MCP tools + the inbox watcher that pushes
  messages into the session. Start here.
- `test/bus.test.ts` — spawns real server processes over stdio and asserts
  discovery, delivery, rename, and offline queueing.
- `scripts/` — install / uninstall / doctor helpers.

See the **How it works** section of the [README](README.md) for the bus design.

## Code style

Match the existing file: TypeScript, 2-space indent, single quotes, no
semicolons, small focused functions. No formatter config is enforced — read the
surrounding code and stay consistent.

## Pull requests

1. Fork and branch from `main`.
2. Add or update a test for any behavior change (`test/bus.test.ts`).
3. Keep the diff focused; one concern per PR.
4. Describe the change and how you verified it.
