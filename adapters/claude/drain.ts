/**
 * claude / hook mode — the *pull* delivery for Claude Code (agentbus).
 *
 * Where the channel mode is a long-running server that PUSHES messages mid-turn via
 * the channels API, this is the opposite shape: a short-lived script that Claude Code
 * invokes at a lifecycle boundary (SessionStart, Stop). On each invocation it
 * reads this session's pending messages and injects them as `additionalContext`,
 * then marks them delivered — a PULL at the turn boundary.
 *
 * Same two ports as every adapter, implemented differently:
 *   - Trigger  (PULL): the Claude Code hook lifecycle (no file-watch, no daemon).
 *   - Delivery (PUSH): the hook's `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` output.
 *
 * The win: it needs NO channel flag, so it reaches sessions that can't load
 * channels (e.g. ones dispatched from the agents panel). The cost: messages
 * arrive only at turn boundaries, not in real time.
 *
 * Registered in ~/.claude/settings.json by `agentbus enable claude hook`.
