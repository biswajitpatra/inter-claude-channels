/**
 * The agentbus standard — core port contracts.
 *
 * The core (presence + message store + delivery tracking) is runtime-agnostic
 * and never imports an adapter. Each runtime plugs in by implementing two
 * driven ports:
 *
 *   - Delivery (PUSH): how a message enters a runtime's live session.
 *       claude-mcp implements it with an MCP `notifications/claude/channel`.
 *   - Trigger  (PULL): how a recipient learns it has mail to drain.
 *       file-watch nudges via a wake file; poll just ticks on an interval.
 *
 * See SPEC.md for the full standard.
 */

/**
 * A message on the bus. Loosely aligned with the A2A message shape (a sender, a
 * recipient, and a text part) so a future A2A bridge is a field mapping, not a
 * redesign. Local delivery stays MCP; A2A is an edge adapter.
